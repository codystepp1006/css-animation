# css-animation

by Cody Stepp

## Description

This project is a demonstration that I know how to utilize css properties to manipulate HTML elements to ahcieve certain goals. Having a strong understanding of CSS fundamentals is extremely important when it comes to being a full-stack developer, or of course, if you mainly work on the front end.

## Requirenments

html, css, and a text editor!

## Usage

HTML, CSS

## GitHub username

- Github: codystepp1006

## How to use it?

Click the link below, once the webpage has opened up, you can hover over the earth/sun to pause the orbit animation. When you click on the Earth, it will take you to a sun setting over the ocean animation. If you click the sun on this page, it will take you back to orbit. That is it! in the future, I will be adding different planets and moons with different unique animations for each!
